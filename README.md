My first repository

Hello! 

My name is Jennifer.  I'm new to coding, and looking to pursue it as a carrer.
My goal is to become a knowledgeable full stack web developer.  At this time, 
I know a bit about HTML, and CSS.  My next step is to gain knowledge about 
JavaScript so I can make websites a bit more interactive for the user.  The 
journey thus far has been great fun.  I've only started the learning process
3 1/2 months ago, but feel I've learned a great deal in that time.  I'm excited
for what's ahead, and can see my goals getting closer on the horizion.
